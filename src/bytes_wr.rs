//! bytes_wr : reader and writer (adapter) when no knowledge of content length (ie a byte stream)
//! The point is to be able to write content without knowledge of the final lenghth and without
//! loading all bytes in memory (only buffer). 
//! Common usecase is tunnel proxy where we do not know the length of content written (encyphered
//! bytes or encodable unknow content), the point is to avoid mismatch between this content and
//! further content.
